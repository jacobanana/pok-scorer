Setup

2 teams of 1 or 2 players each
One blue player and one red player stand on the same side of the table
The team with the youngest player starts

How to Play
1. Rolling the Pok

Players take turns rolling their 4 poks (the wooden discs)
You must release your pok before crossing the third line on your side
You can knock your opponent's poks out of scoring zones

2. Scoring Zones
The board has numbered zones (1, 2, 3 and circles marked 4 and 5). When your pok crosses a line:

If you only see the black line underneath the pok → you score the lower point value
If you see the wood underneath the pok → you score the higher point value

3. Counting Points

After all poks are rolled, tally the scores
Only the team with the higher total scores points that round
Example: Red has 7 points, Blue has 4 points → Red scores 3 points (the difference)

4. Winning

First team to reach 21 points wins
The team that wins a round starts the next round
If there's a tie, the same team starts again

# Keeping Scores

How to Count Points in Pok
Based on the rules, here's the detailed scoring process:
Step 1: Check Each Pok's Position
After all poks have been rolled, look at where each pok has landed on the board.
Step 2: Determine Point Values
For each pok that has crossed a scoring line:

Look underneath the pok where it touches the line
If only the black line is visible → Score the lower number in that zone
If you can see the wood (meaning the pok crossed further) → Score the higher number in that zone

The zones are:

Columns marked 1, 2, 3 (on both sides)
Circles marked 4 and 5

Step 3: Add Up Each Team's Total

Add up all the points for the red team's poks
Add up all the points for the blue team's poks

Step 4: Calculate the Round Score

Only the winning team scores points
The winning team scores the difference between the two totals
Example: Red = 7 points, Blue = 4 points → Red scores 3 points for that round

Step 5: Track Progress

Add the round score to that team's running total
First team to 21 points wins the game

Note: Poks that don't cross any scoring line score 0 points. Poks that fall off the table or don't reach the third line also score nothing.
