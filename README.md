A digital score counter for the POK game - a strategic disc-throwing game where players aim to score points by landing their poks in different scoring zones.

## What is POK?

POK is a tabletop game where two players (Red and Blue) take turns tossing disc-shaped pieces (called "poks") onto a wooden table divided into scoring zones. Players aim for higher-scoring zones while trying to strategically position their poks to maximize their score and potentially knock their opponent's poks into lower-scoring areas.

## Game Rules

### Setup
- **Players:** 2 (Red vs Blue)
- **Poks per round:** 5 each
- **Winning score:** 21 points

### Scoring Zones
The table has several scoring zones, each worth a different number of points:
- **Zone 1:** Worth 1 point
- **Zone 2:** Worth 2 points
- **Zone 3:** Worth 3 points
- **Circle 4:** Worth 4 points
- **Circle 5:** Worth 5 points
- **Anywhere else:** No point

**What if my pok is on a boundary line?** If your pok is touching two zones at the same time, it scores the points of the lower-scoring zone. The areas near boundaries (shown with a diagonal stripe pattern) help you see where you might get the lower score - these are the spots closer to Zone 0.

### How to Play

**What are poks?** A pok is a marble with a plastic ring around it - this design helps it slide smoothly across the table.

1. **Setup:**
   - Players stand at one end of the table
   - Each player has 5 poks for the round
   - Decide who goes first (Red or Blue)

2. **Taking Turns:**
   - Players alternate sliding their poks down the table, aiming for the scoring zones on the other side
   - Think of it like table curling - you slide the pok with enough force to reach the scoring zones
   - The player with fewer total game points always plays next
   - If tied, players alternate turns
   - If one player runs out of poks, the other player continues until all poks are placed

3. **Sliding Technique:**
   - Slide your pok from your end of the table toward the scoring zones
   - You can use your pok to knock opponent's poks into lower-scoring zones or off the table
   - Strategy matters - sometimes blocking is better than scoring!

4. **End of Round:**
   - The round ends when all 10 poks have been played
   - Count up each player's score based on where their poks landed
   - The player with the higher round score wins
   - **Points awarded:** The difference between the two round scores
   - If tied, no points are awarded

5. **Starting the Next Round:**
   - The winner of the previous round starts the next round
   - In case of a tie, the player who didn't start the previous round goes first

6. **Winning the Game:**
   - First player to reach 21 total points wins the game!

### Using the Score Counter

- The background color shows whose turn it is (red or blue)
- The large numbers at top show the total game score
- The scoreboard shows:
  - Current round scores
  - Poks remaining for each player
- Click anywhere on the scoring zones to place a pok
- Click your last-placed pok to remove it
- Drag poks to reposition them
- After all poks are placed, the round automatically ends after a short delay
- Click the round result screen to continue to the next round

## Tips & Strategy

- The 5-point circle is the highest-scoring zone, but it's small and difficult to hit
- Positioning matters - you can knock opponent poks into lower-scoring zones
- The 0-zone in the center-left is strategic for blocking without giving your opponent points
- Save adjustments for after all poks are placed - you have a few seconds to drag and reposition
- Watch the boundary lines - landing too close can drop your score
