A digital score counter for the POK game - a strategic disc-throwing game where players aim to score points by landing their poks in different scoring zones.

## What is POK?

POK is a tabletop game where two players (Red and Blue) take turns tossing disc-shaped pieces (called "poks") onto a wooden table divided into scoring zones. Players aim for higher-scoring zones while trying to strategically position their poks to maximize their score and potentially knock their opponent's poks into lower-scoring areas.

## Game Rules

### Setup
- **Players:** 2 (Red vs Blue)
- **Poks per round:** 5 each
- **Winning score:** 21 points

### Scoring Zones
The table has several scoring zones:
- **Zone 3:** 3 points (or 2 near boundary)
- **Zone 2:** 2 points (or 1 near boundary)
- **Zone 1:** 1 point (or 0 near boundary)
- **Zone 0:** 0 points (center left area)
- **Circle 4:** 4 points (top circle)
- **Circle 5:** 5 points (bottom circle)
- **Outer Zone:** 0 points (off the table)

**Boundary Scoring:** Most zones have a "high" and "low" score depending on where the pok lands. Poks placed near the boundary line toward the 0 zone score the lower value (shown with a diagonal stripe pattern).

### How to Play

1. **Choose Starting Player:** At game start, select which team goes first (Red or Blue)

2. **Taking Turns:**
   - Players alternate placing their poks on the table
   - The player with fewer points always plays next
   - If tied, players alternate turns
   - If one player runs out of poks, the other player continues until all poks are placed

3. **Placing Poks:**
   - Click or tap anywhere on the table to place a pok
   - The score depends on which zone you hit
   - Your last-placed pok can be removed by clicking it
   - You can drag poks to adjust their position before the round ends

4. **End of Round:**
   - The round ends automatically when all 10 poks are placed
   - The player with the higher round score wins
   - **Points awarded:** The difference between the two round scores
   - If tied, no points are awarded

5. **Starting the Next Round:**
   - The winner of the previous round starts the next round
   - In case of a tie, the player who didn't start the previous round goes first

6. **Winning the Game:**
   - First player to reach 21 points wins the game

### Using the Score Counter

- The background color shows whose turn it is (red or blue)
- The large numbers at top show the total game score
- The scoreboard shows:
  - Current round scores
  - Poks remaining for each player
- Click anywhere on the scoring zones to place a pok
- Click your last-placed pok to remove it
- Drag poks to reposition them
- After all poks are placed, the round automatically ends after a short delay
- Click the round result screen to continue to the next round

## Tips & Strategy

- The 5-point circle is the highest-scoring zone, but it's small and difficult to hit
- Positioning matters - you can knock opponent poks into lower-scoring zones
- The 0-zone in the center-left is strategic for blocking without giving your opponent points
- Save adjustments for after all poks are placed - you have a few seconds to drag and reposition
- Watch the boundary lines - landing too close can drop your score
